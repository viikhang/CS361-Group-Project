## Problem statement:
Design a logistics system for a warehouse that needs to manage the movement 
of items. The warehouse is represented as a 2D grid where each cell can 
either be empty, contain an obstacle, or hold an item that needs to be 
collected. The goal is to design a program that can find the shortest path 
from a starting point to collect all items using various graph search 
algorithms. The performance of each algorithm will be compared at the end 


## How to run the program
Running the program starts in the main class. To start the program, you must 
past a text tile to main. In the text file, the first line contains the 
width and height of the 2D grid. The lines after represent how the grid actually
looks like. The grid is represented by three cell types, empty('.'), item('I') 
and an obstacle('O'). Once the program finishes reading in the board, the 
program will apply all the search algorithms implemented.
